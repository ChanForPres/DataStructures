Lab15: Trees2
===

One thing I need to keep in mind: <br \>
	**Trees are naturally helpful to understand recursion** <br \>
	It's often hard to figure out how recursion works on top of my head. That happened for ```height()``` method in AmoebaFamily.
	But I found it very helpful when I think recursion as a **tree** form. <br \>
	So for a famous Fibonacci example, recursion actually is something like <br \>
	
		      fibonacci(7)
	      ____|_____
	     |          |
	fibonacci(5)  fibonacci(6)
	____|____     ____|_____
	|        |    |         |
	fib(3)  fib(4) fib(4)   fib(5)
