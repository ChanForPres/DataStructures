### Inorder Successor vs. Inorder Predecessor
Inorder successor of a node is the next node in Inorder traversal of the Binary Tree. Consider the following tree.
```
		20
	   /  \
	  8   22
	 / \
	4  12
	  /  \
	 10  14
```
The whole inorder traversal goes like this: 4-8-10-12-14-20-22. Therefore inorder successor of 8 is 10. Inorder successor of 10 is 12. Inorder successor of 14 is 20.
