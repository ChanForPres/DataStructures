### Inorder Successor vs. Inorder Predecessor
**Inorder successor** of a node X is the node Y that comes just **after** the node X in inorder traversal of the Binary Tree. Consider the following tree.
```
		20
	   /  \
	  8   22
	 / \
	4  12
	  /  \
	 10  14
```
The whole inorder traversal goes like this: 4-8-10-12-14-20-22. Therefore inorder successor of 8 is 10. Inorder successor of 10 is 12. Inorder successor of 14 is 20.

On the other hand, **inorder predecessor** of a node X is the node Y that comes just **before** node X in inorder traversal. The algorithm is as follows: 

```
1. If root is NULL
      then return
2. if key is found then
    a. If its left subtree is not null,
        Then predecessor will be the right most 
        child of left subtree or left child itself.
    b. If its left subtree is null, 
    	Then predecessor will be the parent of the key
    c. If its right subtree is not null,
        Then successor will be the left most child 
        of right subtree or right child itself.
    d. If its right subtree is null,
    	Then successor will be the key itself.
    return
3. If key is smaller then root node
        set the successor as root
        search recursively into left subtree
    else
        set the predecessor as root
        search recursively into right subtree
```

### Comparable kthLargest (int k)
My own solution: There are two different solutions to find the kth largest element in a binary search.

1. Simpler method: 

First we already have Inorder traversal of the tree and the value k. Then we could call  ```nextElement``` until we get the desired k. However, if ```k``` is near the number of keys ```N``` in the tree, the algorithm's running time is proportional to ```N```. 

2. Trading Memory for Speed 

Here storing in each node the size of the tree rooted at that node and the rank of the tree allows the design of an algorithm runs in time proportional to ```d```, the depth of the tree.

3. TreeMap Phonebook
```TreeMap``` implements ```Comparable``` interface to order the map based on keys
