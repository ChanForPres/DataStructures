Lab 09: LinkedList 1
===

* A straightforward implementation of a linked list that contains myItem and myNext.
* It represents all the values in the sequence with ListNodes, each storing a sequence value myItem and a reference(pointer) myNext. But the problem is there's no way to represent an *empty* sequence.
* To fix this, I continue to implement more classes in lab 10.
