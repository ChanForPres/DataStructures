Lab 4: Arrays, Objects, and JUnit Testing
===
1. Understand a simple data structure: the *array*
2. JUnit Test - *test-driven development*

### Arrays
* An array is an indexed sequence of elements, all the same type. 
* Variable Declaration : We declare an array variable by giving the type of its elemnts, a pair of square brackets and the variable name. We don't specify the length. ```int[] values``` 
* Variable Initialization : To initialize an array, we use the new operator which includes the length. ```values = new int[7]``` 
* Store : ```values[1] = 4```
* Access : Give the name of the array, then supply an index expression. ```values[3]``` If the index is negative or greater than or equal to the length of the array, it throws an exception.

#### Line3.java 
Coordinates become int array. [x1, y1, x2, y2]

#### Line4.java
Coordinates become an array of two Point objects. 

### Argument Passing
#### Copy (Java)
When we pass an argument in Java, it means the argument is **passed by value**. This means that each argument is **copied** into the corresponding paramenter in the method being called. <br \>
    ```int y = 0;
        makeThree(y);
        System.out.println(y); // prints 0```

However, when the arguments are **objects**, the argument to the method is **reference** to the object. More specifically, you copy the **reference**, but not the **object**. <br \>
    ``` int[] origVal = new int[3];
        setFirstToThree(origVal);
        System.out.println(origVal[0]); // prints 3```

### Useful Methods
#### the ```toString``` method
When we create the new class, ```System.out.println``` will output something not useful. So we could add ```toString``` method to the class. 
``` public String toString() {
    return "(" + points[0].getX();
} ```
#### the ```equals``` method
