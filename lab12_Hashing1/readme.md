Lab12 : Hashing 1
===

This is a simple use and more complex implementation of HashMap.
* PhoneBook.java: I used existing Java HashMap class.
* MyHashMap.java: I created my own Hashmap using an array of LinkedList that contains both key and value. To handle collision, I used **chaining**(bucketing) rather than linear probing. I used load factor to decide whether I need to increase the array size.
