Lab 3: Objects
===
1. Understand the declaration and use of reference-typed variables (box-and-pointer diagrams)
2. Separate "tester" class
3. Debugging

### Box and Pointers
#### Primitives (Value)
* When we declare a *primitive* like ```int```, ```boolean```, ```float```, ```char```, we draw a box and label the box with the type of primitive and the name of the variable.
* When we assign value to the primitive, it's pass by value. 

#### Objects (Reference)
* Variables can also refer to *objects*. For example,
``` public class Dog {
        public int myAge;
        public String myName;
    }
``` <br \>
First, if we create a variable ```Dog d;```, a variable ```d``` becomes a *reference* that points to ```null```. <br \>
Second, if we assign the reference to a ```Dog``` object, ```d = new Dog();```, d points to an object ```Dog``` that contains ```int myAge``` and ```String myName```. What is special about an object is that it can store primitives(```int```) and references(```String```) inside. <br \>
If and only if we see the ```new``` keyword, we create an object. <br \>

Q. Why does it make sense that objects are not stored inside variables, but are only referred to them? <br \>
- For primitives, it's just 4 byte information that are very simple and easy to store. However, objects contain a lot more information in terms of quantity and variety. So it's easier to reference that by variable instead of storing it. <br \>
Q. Why does it make sense that objects are not drawn inside other objects? <br \>
- Again, every object varies and contains many kinds of big and small data. For consistency and efficiency, it's makes more sense to make objects always reference.<br \>
Q. Why isn't the blue object box labeled with the name of the variable, for example ```d```? <br \>
- ```d``` is an object that points to ```new Dog()``` not ```d```. So it makes more sense that the blue object doesn't associate with the name ```d```.

### Line1.java
* This is a class representing a line segment as a pair of points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), where all ```x1```, ```y1```, ```x2```, ```y2``` are integer instance variables.

### Line2.java
* Unlike Line1, this class represents a line segment as a pair of *points* that uses the ```Point``` class supplied in the ```java.awt``` class library.

### Account.java
* This class allows deposits and withdrawals. For more money than the account contains, the Account class disallows a withdrawal request.
* withdraw : Overdraft protection by including ```parentAccount``` instance variable and constructor.
* merge : It takes the argument account ```anotherAcct```. Even though ```myBalance``` variable is private, we can access both of the accounts balance information. (demonstrating the limits of private access)

```
public void merge (Account otherAccount) {
    this.myBalance = this.myBalance + otherAccount.myBalance;
    otherAccount = new Account (0);
}
```

Q. This doesn't work. Why not? <br \>
```otherAccount``` is newly created and simply points to another Account object. So the existing ```otherAccount``` is remained unchanged and still contains the balance.

### Debug.java
Debug some recursive code <br \>
1) Describe all pairs of arguments that correctly returns true.

    * It correctly returns true if ```myString``` is the result of inserting one character at the last index into an argument ```s```. ex) abc2, abc
    * It also correctly returns true if the length of ```myString``` is one more than that of ```s```. ex) a, " "

2) Describe all pairs of arguments that correctly returns false. 

    * if ```myString.length()``` < ```s.length``` ex) ab, abc
    * if ```myString.length()``` > ```s.legnth + 2``` ex) abcd, ab
    * if ```myString``` doesn't match with ```s``` in terms of character. ex) abc, def

3) Describe all pairs of arguments that incorrectly returns true. <br \>
4) Describe all pairs of arguments that incorrectly returns false. 

    * if ```myString``` is the result of inserting one character at the first index into an argument ```s```. ex) 2ab, ab
    * if ```myString``` is the result of inserting one character at the middle index into an argument ```s```. ex) a2b, ab

5) Describe all pairs of arguments that crashes.

    * When either ```myString``` or ```s``` is null.

6) Determine what's wrong: I think creating another Debug class might be problematic. <br \>
When ```myString``` contains one character at an index except for the last index, it goes to ```else``` statement. ```else``` statement creates a new String of ```myString``` except for the first word. The problem is to compare two String objects, we cannot use "==" to compare the String contains. Instead, we should use ".equals" to correctly compare two String objects.
