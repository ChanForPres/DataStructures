### String Immutability
In Java, Strings are *immutable*, so once a String is created, it can never be changed. This matters, because every time you append to a String, you have to create an entirely new String, which takes **time** proportional to the length of the whole new String. So if there's a really long String like a length of 1000000000, and then if we were to append a single character to the end, it will take time proportional to 1000000001.

Because adding Strings together is slow, Java has a class called ```StringExpr```, which is kind of like a String, but is **mutable**, and thus support **fast appending**. The following is an example:
```
public static String fastMultiply(String s, int N) {
    StringExpr results = new StringExpr(s); // create a StringExpr from s
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        results.append(s); // use StringExpr's fast append
    }
    return results.toString(); // turn the StringExpr back into a String
}
```
This method takes ```O(N*L)``` because append only takes time proprotional to the length of the String being appended, rather than the size of the whole resulting String.

The difference between using Strings and ```StringBuilder``` is so extreme that Java programmers say you should **never, ever** append to Strings in a loop. **Always** convert to ```StringBuilder``` and convert back to String once appends are done.

### Wildcard Types

#### A problem with Generics and Inheritance
Suppose we have a class ```Point```, whih has a subclass ```TracedPoint```

1. It was okay to do ```Point p = new TracedPoint(3, 4);```. 
2. However, it was **not** okay to do ```ArrayList<Point> points = new ArrayList<TracedPoint>();```. Because ```ArrayList<Point>``` is not a superclass of ```ArrayList<TracedPoint>``` 

So suppose we have method like the following: <br \>
```
public static void printPoints(ArrayList<Point> points) {
    for (Point p: points) {
        System.out.println(p.getX());
    }
}
```
Here, we cannot pass in an ```ArrayList<TracedPoint>``` as an argument.

#### Why?
Assume we **can** do the following assignment: ```ArrayList<Point> points = new ArrayList<TracedPoint>();```. Then the compiler, which sees the **static type**, would think that any subclass of ```Point``` can be added to ```points```. 

So we'd be allowed to do, ```points.add(new WeirdPoint(4, 7));```, where ```WeirdPoint``` is a subclass of ```Point```, but not ```TracedPoint```. However, this doesn't make sense, because we know the dynamic type of ```points``` is ```ArrayList<TracedPoint>```. This cannot be allowed to contain ```WeirdPoint```. Therefore, it's **unsafe**.

#### Wildcards
To resolve this problem, Java introduces a special type knwon as a *wildcard type*. Here's the syntax: 

```ArrayList<? extends Point> points = new ArrayList<TracedPoint>();```. <br \>
This means ```points``` is an ```ArrayList``` of some subclass of ```Point```, but I'm not exactly sure which subclass.

Now, we can do the following method, where we can pass in as an argument an ```ArrayList<TracedPoint>```. This method can handle an ```ArrayList``` of any subclass of ```Point```.

```
public static void printPoints(ArrayList<? extends Point> points) {
    for (Point p: points) {
        System.out.println(p.getX());
    }
}
```

#### A Strange Assymetry
Wildcard types have a strange assymetry associated with them. Consider our ```points``` variable in the ```printPoints``` method above. We are allowed to do ```Point p = points.get(0);```, but not allowed to do ```Point p = new Point(0,2); points.add(p);```. 

In other words, we can **get** things from ```points```, but we cannot **put** things into ```points```.

**Check out my** ```wildcards.txt``` **file**.


### Packages
A package is a **grouping of related classes** (and interfaces) that provides **namespace management** and **access protection**. Sometimes packages are simply used for their organizational benefits. 

Packages correspond to the folders a class is in: If your code is in a package named ```proj1```, then it must also be in a folder named ```proj1/```. If your code is in a package named ```cs61bl.proj1```, then it must be in a nested folder ```cs61bl/proj1```

#### Namespace Management and Importing
Namespace management refers to the concept of **preventing naming collisions**. There are a lot of Java files, some of which are bound to have the same name.

Say you're writing a program and you want to use 2 different classes named ```ArrayList```, which were written by 2 different people. The packages they're in can be used to **distinguish** them. All we have to do is **use the complete pacakge name**.

For example <br \>
```
java.util.ArrayList arr1 = new java.util.ArrayList();
cs61bl.ArrayList arr2 = new cs61bl.ArrayList();
```

**Whenever you refer to a class, you must specify the complete package.**

But we haven't called ```java.util.ArrayList``` all the time. And it's because we **imported it** with a statement like ```import java.util.ArrayList;```


### Java through Terminal
#### The classpath
We can run a Java program from any location on our computer. The class file doesn't even have to be in the same folder. The way you could do this is by **adding these places to something called classpath**, which you can set with the ```-cp``` option. 

1. For example if you want to run a class "HelloWorld" in a folder "deep": ```java -cp deep HelloWorld```

2. If you want to search the current directory for a class "HelloWorld": ```java -cp . HelloWorld```

3. If you want to search multiple directories, you can add multiple locations to the classpath and separate them within colons: ```java -cp .:deep:other HelloWorld``` (This would search for the ```HelloWorld``` class in the current directory, ```deep``` directory, and the ```other``` directory.

4. We **DO NOT** use ```java deep/HelloWorld```

5. Java class in a folder is not necessarily in a package/ Java class in a **package** is necessarily in a folder. 
    * Java class just in a folder: ```java -cp deep HelloWorld```
    * Java class in a package called greetings: ```java greetings.HelloWorld``` (Java is smart to look in the ```greetings``` folder, so you don't have to include it in the classpath. This works as long as the ```greetings``` packages is in the current folder) 

Q. Consider the following directory structure:

```
home
  |__emotions
        |__deep
             |__greetings
                    |__friendly
                           |__HelloWorld.class
```
You're in the ```home/``` folder and you want to run ```HelloWorld```. It's in a package ```greetings.friendly```, but just in ```emotions/deep/```. Correct Command is ```java -cp emotions/deep greetings.friendly.HelloWorld```

#### Compiling in Folders and Packages
We mentioned that we could **add multiple different locations to the classpath**. But why?

1. Because it can be useful for compiling one class that depends on other classes in different locations. 
    * e.g. Suppose we're trying to compile the file ```A.java``` which references the classes ```B``` and ```C```. To compile ```A.java```, the classes ```B``` and ```C``` have to be on the classpath as well.

2. Because it can be useful for using packages.
    * e.g. To compile a class ```coolpackage.A``` which references the classes ```oddpackage.B``` and ```weirdpackage.C```, the locations of the packages ```oddpackage``` and ```weirdpackage``` must be on the classpath.

##### !Confusing part 
When we **run Java programs**, we always use the class name (with packages). If the class is in another folder, we have to include that folder on the classpath. <br \>
When we **compile**, however, we use the file name, not the class name. e.g. ```javac deep/HelloWorld.java```

This is different from how we would **run the class**. When running a Java program, ```-cp``` is used to indicate the **location of the class that could be found**. When **compiling a Java file**, ```-cp``` is used to **indicate the location of classes and packages that the file might depend on**.

### Using Other people's code
Often it's useful to use classes written by other people that aren't included by default in Java. You can download these off the internet, often in the form of **JAR** files.

JAR stands for Java Archive. It is a **package file format** used to aggregate many Java .class files and associated metadata(e.g. text, images). A JAR file is nothing more than a .zip file for Java projects.

JAR files are generally used to distribute **application software or libraries**. JAR files are used because it is often unreasonable to give many separate, unorganized .class files to developers. Packaging all these .class files together into a runnable archive makes it easy to share complicated Java programs with other people.

ex) JUnit JAR files: JUnit is a complicated package with many different class files. These are all packaged into two JUnit JAR
