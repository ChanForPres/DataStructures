CS61BL - Data Structure
===

### Data Structures and Algorithms
Much of 61BL will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data and this is my own exercise to understand and code fundamental parts of data structures. This is written in Java and includes in-depth explanations on my reflections and understandings of what I've learned so far. Special thanks to UC Berkeley Computer Science department for offering a nice outline of learning data structure.
