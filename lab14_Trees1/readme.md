# Understanding trees
## Amoeba Family Tree
* Make all names lower case: ```public void makeNamesLowercase()```
* Replace the name of an Amoeba: ```public void replaceName(String currentName, String newName)```
* Print the names of all Amoebas in the Family: ```public void printFlat()```
* Pretty print the names of all Amoebas in the Family: using helper function
* Returns the length of the longest name in the Amoeba family: ```public int longestNameLength()```
* Finds the busiest Amoeba: using helper function
* Computes the height of a node in a tree: ```private int height()```


## Binary Trees:
* ```Height``` method
* ```isCompletelyBalanced``` method: tree is completely balanced if and only if the height of its left child is equal to the height of its right child, and its left and right children are also completely balanced.
